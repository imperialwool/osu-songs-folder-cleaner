## What this script do?
This script check out all folders and delete all folders, that not contain mp3, osu or jpg/png files as background.

Of course you can disable some features, because script asks you "do you wanna enable this checking". Also if you aren't sure that you wanna start, here's confirmation of your acts.

## What if I have idea how to do code much cleaner, faster and/or smarter?

Feel free for do pull requests! I check every pull request and thinking, is it neccessary to merge this to main code. So, maybe you can do script better!

## What if I haven't Python?
Here's builded .exe file! Thanks to PyInstaller.

So, Windows users and users, who haven't Python, don't worry and feel free to use this code. :)
